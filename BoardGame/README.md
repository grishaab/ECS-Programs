The objective of the game is to get as many points, or '$', as possible on the board without hitting any buildings or enemies. 

Buildings typically look like this: 
"------"
"------"
"--&&--"
"--&&--"
Enemies are 'X' and will end the game upon meeting. 
The asterisks are special powerups, which the player can use for 6 more moves. With this powerup, you get points if you meet an enemy.
