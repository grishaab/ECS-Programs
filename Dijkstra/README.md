Implemented an optimized Dijkstra algorithm to mimic a simulator for Covid-19 infection rates. 

This program determines how many days it would take for Covid-19 to infect an entire population when a few starting individuals are infected.
Every person in this population have information about who they regularly visit and how often, and they also could meet in groups. 
Once a person is infected, they will have a 3-day incubation period where they are not contageous. 

The challenge of this program was to write a Dijkstra's algorithm such that it runs faster than the class instructor, Sean Davis.
