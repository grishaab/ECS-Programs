The objective of the game is to get as many points, or '$', as possible on the board without hitting any buildings or enemies. 

A building is always a 4-by-6 block of dashes except for a “door” built with ampersands in the middle of it. 
Enemies are 'X' and will end the game upon meeting. 
The asterisks are special powerups, which the player can use for 6 more moves. With this powerup, you get points if you meet an enemy.
